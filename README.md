# GPA-Calculator
A basic Java program for calculating Grade Point Average (GPA) is included in this repository. Users can dynamically enter their course name, course code, course unit, and scores into the software. The application then computes the GPA, shows the result on the console, and displays the entered courses and values in a tabular format.
